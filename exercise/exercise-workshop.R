# Packages ----
library(jsonlite) ## for converting and reading JSON files
library(rjson) ## for converting and reading JSON files - a second alternative

# API initial checkup ----

## Let's check if we can get the API set up and running properly.

## Our goal is to have an API returning a fixed status message ("All good") and
## the current time to any request. 

## Once we have checked the API is running properly, we can practice general
## formatting (title and description) and the inclusion of a parameter for the
## incoming request.

## Annotations go here: (#*) and (@)
## Annotations go here: (#*) and (@)
## Next comes the function


# Exercise main goal ----

## Now we must further structure the API so that entries of penguin collection
## data return species probabilities. Let's check the API with (hypothetical)
## data collected by Humboldt and Freie.

## Once we are confident that the API is returning the right output, let's
## insert a new command to make the output a csv file.
